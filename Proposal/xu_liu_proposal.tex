%1. a description of the model you are replicating:
%    - what is it a model of?
%    - what is it a model for? (ie, what can a user learn from it?)

%2. the *conceptual* design of the existing model:
%    - what are the parts of the system?
%    - what states can they take?
%    - how do the parts interact?
%    - how are states updated?
%    - what are the parameters of the system?

%3. a plan for how you intend to implement this in Java?
%    - what objects, classes, data structures will you use?

%4. (perhaps, if you have already spent some time playing with the NetLogo model) the experiments you intend to run:
%    - what are the key behaviours/dynamics of the system?
%    - how do these behaviours/dynamics change with parameter values?

    \section{Descriptive Overview}
        Our group decides to replicate the \textbf{Rebellion} model.
        This model is based on model of civil violence by Joshua Epstein (2002).
        It describes the how agents behave against central authority in relation
        to their grievance and power of authority. Where grievance of agents
        depends on government legitimacy, perceived hardship and risk aversion 
        of each individual. Power of authority is determined by number of police
        officers, their vision and maximum jail terms. There are two global 
        variables in the model that cannot be directly set in the interface that 
        are \textbf{k}, the factor for determining arrest probability, and 
        \textbf{threshold} for agents to rebel.

    \section{Design of Rebellion Model}
        There are two kinds of members in this model, \textbf{agents} and 
        \textbf{police officers}. Police officers only has one state that is
        arresting active agents (rebelled agents) in their vision. If there are
        more than one active agents in the vision, they will arrest randomly one
        of them. There are three different states for agents, quiet, active and
        jailed. The state update rule are as following:
        \subsection{\[Quiet \Rightarrow Active\]}
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                grievance\:-\:riskAversion\:\times\:estimatedArrestProbability\:>\:threshold \\
                \text{Where}\ grievance\:=\:perceivedHardship\:\times\:(1\:-\:governmentLegitimacy)
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        \subsection{\[Active \Rightarrow Quiet\]}
        \subsection{\[Active \Rightarrow Jailed\]}
            If police officers find active agents in their vision, they will
            randomly arrest one of these active agents and change their state from
            \textbf{active} to \textbf{jailed}.
        \subsection{\[Jailed \Rightarrow Quiet\]}
        \subsection{\[Active \Rightarrow Quiet\]}
