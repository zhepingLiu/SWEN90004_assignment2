1. a description of the model you are replicating:
    - what is it a model of?
    - what is it a model for? (ie, what can a user learn from it?)

2. the *conceptual* design of the existing model:
    - what are the parts of the system?
    - what states can they take?
    - how do the parts interact?
    - how are states updated?
    - what are the parameters of the system?

3. a plan for how you intend to implement this in Java?
    - what objects, classes, data structures will you use?

4. (perhaps, if you have already spent some time playing with the NetLogo model) the experiments you intend to run:
    - what are the key behaviours/dynamics of the system?
    - how do these behaviours/dynamics change with parameter values?
